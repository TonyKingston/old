							<h1>Forward+ and Clustered Rendering</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Lighting is an important part of games, and the desire to push the limits of lighting has led to the development of several different rendering algorithms over the years. For my MComp dissertation, I compared traditonal forward rendering with deferred, forward+ (tiled forward) and clustered rendering. The latter two are the most interesting, so I'd like to take some time to discuss how I implemented them and the results that they gave.</p>
							<h2>Forward+</h2>
							<p>The principle idea behind forward+ is to uniformly divide the screen into tiles. For each tile, we check against every light volume in the scene to see which ones overlap with the tile. A buffer is maintained to keep track of which lights are assigned to which tiles. When it comes to final shading, we calculate the tile the current pixel is in, fetch the list of assigned lights, and then only evaluate the lighting equation for these lights. Compared to the brute force method of evaluating every light for every pixel, forward+ is much more efficient.</p>
							<p>In my implementation, I opted for 16x16 tiles which gives 8160 tiles at 1920x1080p resolution. The tile grid is built during the programs initialisation. The tiles are expressed in view space, so there is no need to recompute them unless the fov, screen size of tile size change. The compute shader responsible for constructing the grid is dispatched with a thread group per tile, where one thread then creates the tile. Initially, I used view space frustums to perform intersection tests against the light volumes. However, I later combined this with AABB tests to further reduce false positives. The process of building a frustum is described by Algorithm 1.</p>

							<p>The first step is to determine the screen space positions of the tile’s corners at the camera’s far plane. Shown in lines 2-5, the x and y components of these points is easily obtained by taking the ID of the current work group, adding one were needed to get each corner, and multiplying it by the tile size. Then each of these points is converted to view space. On lines 9-12, the left, right, top and bottom side of the tile’s frustum is calculated by constructing a plane between two of the points and the origin. The front and back planes are calculated later in the light culling phase. The resulting frustum is written out to a buffer where the index of the tile is used as an index into the buffer.</p>
							<p>In the light culling phase, a compute shader is again dispatched with thread groups equal to the number of tiles, but this time each group has 16x16 threads. I calculate the front and back planes of each group's tile by sampling the depth buffer that's filled from performing a depth prepass. Each thread takes a sample, and all samples are atomically compared to find the min and max values. The results are converted into view space so they can be used for the intersection test. The actual culling is described by Algorithm 2.</p>

							<p>On line two, the algorithm gets the frustum for the current tile. In the compute shader, one thread in each work group is responsible for getting that tile’s frustum. All threads in a group share a variable <i>count</i>, which keeps track of how many lights have been recorded for the tile.</p>
							<p>On lines 4-11, the shader iterates through each light source contained in the light buffer and performs an intersection test between the light and the tile’s frustum. The intersection algorithm that I used is adapted from Christer Ericson’s book Real-Time Collision Detection. Since the frustums are calculated in view space, the position of the light source is multiplied with the view matrix before performing the test. First, the shader checks if the sphere lies outside the far or near planes and early outs if so. If the algorithm determines that the sphere is not inside the negative halfspace of any of the four planes, then it must be inside the frustum. On line 6 we then check if the sphere is within the minimum depth bound of the frustum. Separating the test into two stages makes it easy for the program to be extended to handle lighting for transparent objects. If this isn’t a concern, the frustum test can go ahead by immediately considering the calculated near and far depth bounds. With 16x16 threads, the testing of lights is divided into batches of 256. Threads will halt if their light index goes beyond the current number of lights in the scene or if <i>count</i> &gt= L <sub>max</sub>

							<h2>Clustered</h2>
							<p>Clustered rendering acts as an extension on the idea of forward+. It introduces a third dimension by subdividing the screen along the depth axis to create sets of 3D clusters.</p>
